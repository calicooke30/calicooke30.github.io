        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Cali Cooke! I am currently studying software development at MITT. I created this website to showcase some of the
            work I've done during my studies, and to introduce myself! A few things about me...
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I love cooking and baking, I make the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookies known to man. (thanks to the stardew valley cookbook)
            </li>
            <li>
                I spend most of my time playing video games, I love games with a story the most. (ex. The Last of Us, Sally Face)
            </li>
            <li>
                I am very crafty! I love crocheting, bead embroidery, and plain old embroidery!
